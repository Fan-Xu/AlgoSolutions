/*
 * Given a binary search tree and a new tree node, insert the node into the tree. You should keep the tree still be a valid binary search tree.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given binary search tree as follow, after Insert node 6, the tree should be:

  2             2
 / \           / \
1   4   -->   1   4
   /             / \ 
  3             3   6
Challenge
Can you do it without recursion?
