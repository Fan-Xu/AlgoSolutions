/*
 * Given two strings, find the longest common substring.

Return the length of it.

 Notice

The characters in substring should occur continuously in 
original string. This is different with subsequence.

Example
Given A = "ABCD", B = "CBCE", return 2.

Challenge
O(n x m) time and memory.
