/*
 * Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
 

return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
