/*
 * Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array, value from 0 to 10000) and an query list. For each query, give you an integer, return the number of element in the array that are smaller than the given integer.

 Notice

We suggest you finish problem Segment Tree Build and Segment Tree Query II first.

Example
For array [1,2,7,8,5], and queries [1,8,5], return [0,4,2]

Challenge 
Could you use three ways to do it.

Just loop
Sort and binary search
Build Segment Tree and Search.
