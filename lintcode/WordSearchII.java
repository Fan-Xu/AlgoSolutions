/*
 * Given a matrix of lower alphabets and a dictionary. Find all words in the dictionary that can be found in the matrix. A word can start from any position in the matrix and go left/right/up/down to the adjacent position. 

Example
Given matrix:
doaf
agai
dcan
and dictionary:
{"dog", "dad", "dgdg", "can", "again"}

return {"dog", "dad", "can", "again"}


dog:
doaf
agai
dcan
dad:
doaf
agai
dcan
can:
doaf
agai
dcan
again:
doaf
agai
dcan
Challenge 
Using trie to implement your algorithm.
