/*
 * Given a list of integers, which denote a permutation.

Find the previous permutation in ascending order.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
 Notice

The list may contains duplicate integers.

Example
For [1,3,2,3], the previous permutation is [1,2,3,3]

For [1,2,3,4], the previous permutation is [4,3,2,1]
